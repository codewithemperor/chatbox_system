        title: 'Introduction to Programming Languages',
        content: `Programming languages are formal languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer. They are the foundation of software development and enable developers to create applications, websites, and systems.

There are several types of programming languages:

1. **High-Level Languages**: These are closer to human language and easier to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript. They abstract away complex hardware details.

2. **Low-Level Languages**: These are closer to machine code and provide more direct control over hardware. Examples include Assembly and Machine Code.

3. **Compiled Languages**: These are translated directly into machine code before execution. Examples include C, C++, and Go. They typically offer better performance.

4. **Interpreted Languages**: These are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. They offer more flexibility.

When choosing a programming language, consider factors like:
- Project requirements and scope
- Performance needs
- Development time and ease of use
- Community support and available libraries
- Target platform and deployment environment`,

        title: 'Understanding Variables and Data Types',
        content: `Variables are fundamental building blocks in programming that store data values. Think of them as containers that hold information which can be changed during program execution.

**Variable Declaration and Initialization:**
- Declaration: Specifying the variable's name and type
- Initialization: Assigning an initial value to the variable

**Common Data Types:**

1. **Integer**: Whole numbers without decimal points
   - Examples: 42, -17, 0
   - Used for counting, indexing, and mathematical operations

2. **Floating-Point**: Numbers with decimal points
   - Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 2.0
   - Used for precise calculations and measurements

3. **String**: Sequence of characters
   - Examples: "Hello, World!", "John Doe", "12345"
   - Used for text manipulation and display

4. **Boolean**: Logical values representing true or false
   - Examples: true, false
   - Used for conditional logic and decision making

5. **Character**: Single alphanumeric symbols
   - Examples: 'A', 'b', '7', '$'
   - Used for text processing and character manipulation

**Variable Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive names that indicate the variable's purpose
- Start with a letter or underscore
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Follow camelCase or snake_case conventions
- Be consistent throughout your code

**Best Practices:**
- Initialize variables when declaring them
- Use appropriate data types for your data
- Choose meaningful variable names
- Keep variable scope as small as possible
- Use constants for values that don't change`,

        title: 'Control Structures: Conditional Statements',
        content: `Control structures are programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program's execution. Conditional statements enable your program to make decisions based on certain conditions.

**If Statements:**
The most basic conditional statement that executes code only if a specified condition is true.

\`\`\`python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true
\`\`\`

**If-Else Statements:**
Provides an alternative path when the condition is false.

\`\`\`python
if condition:
    # Code if condition is true
else:
    # Code if condition is false
\`\`\`

**Else-If Ladder:**
Allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.

\`\`\`python
if condition1:
    # Code if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # Code if condition2 is true
else:
    # Code if all conditions are false
\`\`\`

**Switch Statements:**
A cleaner way to handle multiple conditions based on a single variable value.

\`\`\`javascript
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // Code for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code if no cases match
}
\`\`\`

**Conditional Operators:**
- Equal to (==, ===)
- Not equal to (!=, !==)
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (>=)
- Less than or equal to (<=)

**Logical Operators:**
- AND (&&, and): All conditions must be true
- OR (||, or): At least one condition must be true
- NOT (!, not): Reverses the logical state

**Best Practices:**
- Keep conditions simple and readable
- Use proper indentation
- Consider all possible cases
- Avoid nested conditionals when possible
- Use meaningful variable names in conditions`,

        title: 'Understanding Time and Space Complexity',
        content: `Time and space complexity are fundamental concepts in algorithm analysis that help us understand how efficient an algorithm is.

**Time Complexity:**
Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It's typically expressed using Big O notation.

**Common Time Complexities:**

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**: Runtime doesn't change with input size
   - Examples: Accessing an array element by index, hash table lookup
   - Most efficient complexity

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**: Runtime grows logarithmically with input size
   - Examples: Binary search, balanced tree operations
   - Very efficient for large datasets

3. **O(n) - Linear Time**: Runtime grows linearly with input size
   - Examples: Linear search, iterating through an array
   - Efficient for most practical purposes

4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**: Runtime grows in proportion to n log n
   - Examples: Merge sort, quick sort (average case)
   - Good for sorting algorithms

5. **O(n¬≤) - Quadratic Time**: Runtime grows quadratically with input size
   - Examples: Bubble sort, nested loops
   - Less efficient for large datasets

6. **O(2^n) - Exponential Time**: Runtime doubles with each addition to input
   - Examples: Recursive Fibonacci, brute-force problems
   - Generally impractical for large inputs

**Space Complexity:**
Space complexity measures how much additional memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows.

**Space Complexity Categories:**

1. **O(1) - Constant Space**: Uses fixed amount of additional space
   - Examples: In-place algorithms, iterative solutions
   - Most space-efficient

2. **O(n) - Linear Space**: Uses additional space proportional to input size
   - Examples: Creating a copy of an array, recursive solutions
   - Reasonable for most applications

3. **O(n¬≤) - Quadratic Space**: Uses space proportional to n¬≤
   - Examples: Creating adjacency matrices for graphs
   - Can be memory-intensive

**Analysis Techniques:**

1. **Best Case**: Minimum time/space required
2. **Average Case**: Expected performance across all inputs
3. **Worst Case**: Maximum time/space required
4. **Amortized Analysis**: Average performance over a sequence of operations

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Avoid unnecessary nested loops
- Use memoization or caching
- Consider trade-offs between time and space
- Profile and measure actual performance

**Practical Considerations:**
- Big O notation describes growth rate, not actual runtime
- Constants and lower-order terms are ignored in Big O
- Real-world performance depends on hardware and implementation
- Sometimes a "worse" algorithm performs better on typical inputs`,

      // Data Structures Notes
      {
        title: 'Arrays: The Fundamental Data Structure',
        content: `Arrays are one of the most fundamental and widely used data structures in computer science. They store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient access to elements by their index.

**Key Characteristics of Arrays:**

1. **Fixed Size**: Most arrays have a fixed size determined at creation
2. **Contiguous Memory**: Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations
3. **Random Access**: Any element can be accessed in O(1) time using its index
4. **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements must be of the same data type

**Array Operations and Their Complexities:**

1. **Access by Index**: O(1)
   - Direct access using array_name[index]
   - Most efficient operation

2. **Search**: O(n)
   - Linear search through elements
   - Can be O(log n) if array is sorted (binary search)

3. **Insertion**: O(n)
   - Inserting at beginning or middle requires shifting elements
   - Inserting at end is O(1) if space is available

4. **Deletion**: O(n)
   - Deleting from beginning or middle requires shifting elements
   - Deleting from end is O(1)

5. **Traversal**: O(n)
   - Visiting each element exactly once

**Types of Arrays:**

1. **One-Dimensional Arrays**: Simple list of elements
   - Example: int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

2. **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: Arrays of arrays
   - Example: int[][] matrix = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};

3. **Dynamic Arrays**: Arrays that can grow and shrink
   - Examples: ArrayList in Java, Vector in C++, list in Python
   - Automatically resize when needed

**Common Array Algorithms:**

1. **Linear Search**: Sequential search for an element
   - Simple but inefficient for large arrays

2. **Binary Search**: Efficient search on sorted arrays
   - Requires array to be sorted first
   - O(log n) time complexity

3. **Sorting**: Arrange elements in specific order
   - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
   - Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort

4. **Rotation**: Shift elements circularly
   - Left rotation and right rotation
   - Useful in various applications

**Advantages of Arrays:**
- Fast random access to elements
- Cache-friendly due to contiguous memory
- Simple to understand and implement
- Memory efficient (no extra storage for pointers)

**Disadvantages of Arrays:**
- Fixed size (in most implementations)
- Costly insertion and deletion operations
- May waste memory if allocated size is not fully used
- Not suitable for dynamic data that changes frequently

**Best Practices:**
- Use arrays when the number of elements is known in advance
- Choose appropriate size to avoid frequent resizing
- Consider using dynamic arrays for unknown sizes
- Be mindful of array bounds to prevent errors
- Use built-in array methods when available`,

      {
        title: 'Linked Lists: Dynamic Data Structures',
        content: `Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) contains a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

**Basic Structure of a Linked List Node:**
\`\`\`python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data    # The data stored in the node
        self.next = None   # Reference to the next node
\`\`\`

**Types of Linked Lists:**

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node
   - Simplest form
   - Can only traverse in one direction

2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both next and previous nodes
   - Allows bidirectional traversal
   - Uses more memory per node

3. **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to the first node
   - Can be singly or doubly linked
   - Useful for applications requiring circular access

**Linked List Operations and Complexities:**

1. **Insertion**: O(1) at head, O(n) at tail or specific position
   - No need to shift elements
   - Simply update pointers

2. **Deletion**: O(1) at head, O(n) at tail or specific position
   - Update pointers to remove node
   - No shifting required

3. **Search**: O(n)
   - Must traverse from head
   - No random access

4. **Access by Index**: O(n)
   - Must traverse from beginning
   - Less efficient than arrays

**Advantages of Linked Lists:**
- Dynamic size: Can grow or shrink as needed
- Efficient insertion and deletion
- No memory waste (only allocate what's needed)
- Useful for implementing other data structures (stacks, queues)

**Disadvantages of Linked Lists:**
- No random access to elements
- Extra memory required for pointers
- Not cache-friendly (non-contiguous memory)
- More complex to implement and debug

**Common Linked List Applications:**

1. **Implementing Stacks and Queues**
   - Linked lists provide efficient push/pop operations

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Used in systems where memory allocation varies

3. **Navigation Systems**
   - Browser history (forward/back navigation)
   - Music playlists

4. **Polynomial Representation**
   - Each term can be represented as a node

**Basic Linked List Operations Implementation:**

**Insertion at Head:**
\`\`\`python
def insert_at_head(head, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = head
    return new_node  # New head of the list
\`\`\`

**Deletion at Head:**
\`\`\`python
def delete_at_head(head):
    if head is None:
        return None
    new_head = head.next
    head.next = None  # Help garbage collection
    return new_head
\`\`\`

**Search Operation:**
\`\`\`python
def search(head, target):
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        if current.data == target:
            return True
        current = current.next
    return False
\`\`\`

**Best Practices:**
- Always handle edge cases (empty list, single node)
- Use dummy nodes to simplify insertion/deletion
- Consider memory management and garbage collection
- Choose the right type of linked list for your needs
- Document the structure and operations clearly`,
