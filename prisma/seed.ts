        question: 'What is a programming language?',
        answer: 'A programming language is a formal language designed to communicate instructions to a computer. It provides a way to write programs that can be executed by a computer to perform specific tasks. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Programming languages have syntax (rules for writing code) and semantics (meaning of the code).',

        topicName: 'Programming Basics'
      },
      {
        question: 'What are variables in programming?',
        answer: 'Variables are containers for storing data values. In programming, a variable is a named location in memory that holds a value which can be changed during program execution. Variables have a name (identifier), a data type (like integer, string, boolean), and a value. For example: int age = 25; or string name = "John";',
        keywords: JSON.stringify(['variable', 'data', 'memory', 'identifier', 'data type']),
        topicName: 'Programming Basics'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?',
        answer: 'Compiled languages (like C, C++, Go) are translated directly into machine code by a compiler before execution, resulting in faster performance. Interpreted languages (like Python, JavaScript, Ruby) are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, making them more flexible but generally slower. Some languages like Java use both compilation and interpretation.',
        keywords: JSON.stringify(['compiled', 'interpreted', 'compiler', 'interpreter', 'execution']),
        topicName: 'Programming Basics'
      },

        question: 'What is an algorithm?',
        answer: 'An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are the foundation of computer programming and are used for tasks like sorting data, searching information, and performing calculations.',

        topicName: 'Algorithms'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is time complexity in algorithms?',
        answer: 'Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input. It\'s typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the growth rate. Common time complexities include O(1) constant, O(log n) logarithmic, O(n) linear, O(n log n) linearithmic, O(n¬≤) quadratic, and O(2^n) exponential.',

      {
        question: 'What is an array?',
        answer: 'An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Arrays are indexed, meaning each element has a numerical index (starting from 0) that allows direct access to any element. Arrays are used for storing multiple values in a single variable and are fundamental in programming.',

        topicName: 'Data Structures'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is a linked list?',
        answer: 'A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements but have slower access times compared to arrays.',

The CPU executes instructions from programs, performs arithmetic and logical operations, and manages data flow between other components. Key parts of the CPU include the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit, and registers.',

        topicName: 'Computer Architecture'
      },
      {
        question: 'What is RAM?',
        answer: 'Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order. It\'s used to store working data and machine code currently in use. RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its contents when the computer is turned off. More RAM generally allows a computer to work with more information at the same time, improving performance.',

        question: 'What is an operating system?',
        answer: 'An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and computer hardware. Major functions include process management, memory management, file systems, device control, and networking. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.',

IP addresses are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network. The two main versions are IPv4 (32-bit addresses) and IPv6 (128-bit addresses).
